Media-Foundation-Ports
======================
Media-Foundation-Ports intends to port over common DirectShow codecs to the new Microsoft Media Foundation framework that was introduced in Windows Vista.

We only intend to provide the demultiplexers and the codecs. External media players, like MPC-HC, will need to actually start using the new Media Foundation framework in order to use our libraries.
